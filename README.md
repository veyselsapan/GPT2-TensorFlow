# GPT Model Project

## Overview
This project implements a custom GPT (Generative Pre-trained Transformer) model using TensorFlow. It is designed for training, evaluating, and making predictions with the GPT model. The project is structured into multiple modules for ease of understanding and modification.

## Prerequisites
Before running this project, ensure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.8 or above
- TensorFlow 2.x
- Hugging Face's Transformers library
- Einops
- Scikit-learn (optional, for additional metrics calculation)

## Setup
1. **Clone the Repository**: Clone this repository to your local machine or download the source code.

    ```bash
    git clone <repository-url>
    ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment** (recommended): 

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # For Unix or MacOS
    venv\Scripts\activate  # For Windows
    ```

3. **Install Dependencies**: Install all the required libraries.

    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow transformers einops scikit-learn
    ```

## Running the Script
Navigate to the directory where the script is located and run it using the following command:

```bash
python main.py
```

The script will interactively ask you to choose a mode (`train`, `evaluate`, or `predict`) and to provide the necessary input parameters based on the chosen mode.

### Modes
- **Train**: Trains the GPT model with the specified parameters.
- **Evaluate**: Evaluates the trained model on a test dataset.
- **Predict**: Generates text based on a given input prompt using the trained model.

### Input Parameters
- `output_dir`: Directory path where the TFRecord files are stored.
- `checkpoint_dir`: Directory path for saving training checkpoints.
- `model_path`: Path to the saved model for prediction or evaluation.
- `input`: Input text for prediction.
- `batch_size`: Batch size for training/evaluation.
- `max_length`: Maximum length of input sequences.
- `epochs`: Number of training epochs.
- `learning_rate`: Learning rate for the optimizer.

## Project Structure
- `model.py`: Defines the GPT model architecture.
- `train.py`: Contains the training loop and logic.
- `evaluate.py`: Code for model evaluation.
- `predict.py`: Script for making predictions using the trained model.
- `data_loader.py`: Manages loading, preprocessing, and saving of the dataset.
- `config.py`: Configuration settings for the model.
- `main.py`: The entry point of the application.
- `utility.py`: Helper functions used across the project.

## Additional Notes
- Ensure that the `output_dir` contains the preprocessed data in TFRecord format before starting training or evaluation.
- For prediction, a pre-trained model saved in the specified `model_path` is required.
